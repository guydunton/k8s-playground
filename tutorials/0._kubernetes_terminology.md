# 0. Kubernetes Terminology

## Control plane

This is the management portion of Kubernetes. It handles the API and runs the continuous update loop.

## Nodes

These are the cloud instances which will run containers. Each node is a large instance running a Kubernetes process which communicates with the control plane.

## Pods

Pods are collections of one or more containers.

## Deployments

Deployments are collections of pods. Normally, when a pod dies it is not recreated but a deployment will create new pods when one terminates. They also manage rolling out updates.

## Services

Services are the equivalent to load balancers. They provide a stable internal or external DNS name for a collection of pods.

## Ingress

Ingress is a beta feature of Kubernetes. Using separate components, Ingress can requisition AWS application load balancers which route to one or many services. They can also setup DNS names for services in Route53.
