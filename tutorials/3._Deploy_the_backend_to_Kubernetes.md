# 3. Deploy the backend to Kubernetes

## Goals

- Get backend image pushed to ECR
- Run the image in kubernetes

## Steps

- Create a container registry for your image (`Create repository`)
- Build the image and push to registry (follow the steps in ECR)
- Update the manifests in /kubernetes with consistent namespaces, the correct image & a dns name of your choice
- Apply the manifests to the kubernetes cluster (`kubectl apply -f backend-namespace.yaml`)

## Further Actions

- Try to scale the deployment to run more instances
- Add a healthcheck to the deployment
